# Rorient

Rorient is a ruby gem thought as a lightweight ORM on top of OrientDB HTTP API.

It has:

- Migrations (loosely based on sql_migrations)
- ActiveRecord like methods (loosely based on OHM)
- Sequel like db instantiation and model data declaration

It is being actively developed thanks to [Makeplan](http://www.makeplan.it)
